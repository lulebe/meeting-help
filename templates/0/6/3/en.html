<h2>Promoting a user to be presenter</h2>
<p>
  Click the user's name in the user list (possibly hidden, if so click the button in the top left to open the list) and make them presenter:
  <img src="/images/contents/hc-admin-useroptions.jpg">
  The user can now share their screen, upload and control presentations, create polls and show videos.
