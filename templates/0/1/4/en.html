<h2>Echo / Feedback</h2>
<p>
  If you hear an Echo or "Feedback", which is usually a very annoying high pitch sound, check who is causing it.
  Everyone who is currently talking lights up at the top of the main window. If someone isn't actually talking, but lights up when others talk,
  they might be causing the issue. Politely let them know them via chat or voice and send them to <a href="/#0-1-4">this page</a> to fix the issue.
