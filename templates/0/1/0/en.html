  Possible reasons why you might not hear anything include:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Audio settings</strong>: Make sure your device is set to the right audio output and the volume is not muted.</li>
    <li><strong>Browser settings</strong>: Some browser allow muting a tab. Right-click the heiconf browser tab in the tab bar (top of your browser window) and check if you can un-mute it there.</li>
  </ul>
