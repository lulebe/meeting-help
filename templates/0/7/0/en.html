  You can then pick the number of rooms, the duration of the breakout session and whether users can manually switch into a different room.
  Users can either be assigned manually (via drag and drop) or randomly:

  Users will leave the main room audio conference upon joining a breakout room. They can join back into the main room at any time.

  To end a breakout session early, click "Breakout rooms" above the user list and choose the option to close all breakout rooms.
