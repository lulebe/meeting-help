<h2>Joing Breakout rooms as a participant</h2>
<p>
  If the moderator allows you to freely choose a breakout room, you will see a list of all rooms when clicking the breakout rooms menu item:
  <img src="/images/contents/hc-breakout-join.jpg">
  You can join any of the available rooms there. Upon joining a breakout room, you will be disconnected from the audio conference in the main room.
