<h2>Using the shared Whiteboard</h2>
<p>
  Presenters and Moderators can draw into presentations and allow this for all users. The default presentation has multiple empty slides
  to use as a whiteboard. Moving to a different slide keeps annotations on other slides intact.<br>
  The Whiteboard feature can be accessed via a menu on the right side:
