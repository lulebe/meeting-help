<h2>Presentation doesn't load</h2>
<p>
  Some files result in issues when trying to show them in heiconf. The easiest solution is to use screen sharing
  for the presentation:
  <img src="/images/contents/hc-presenter-screensharing.jpg">
  <strong>Note for macOS</strong>: Screen sharing requires macOS' permission. You may be asked to grant permission
  and will then have to restart the browser and rejoin the meeting.
